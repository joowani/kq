class Queue(object):
    """KQ queue.

    A queue serializes incoming function calls and places them into a Kafka
    topic as *jobs*. Workers fetch these jobs and execute them asynchronously
    in the background. Here is an example of initializing and using a queue:

    .. code-block:: python

        from kq import Queue, Job

        queue = Queue(
            hosts='host:7000,host:8000',
            topic='foo',
            timeout=3600,
            compression='gzip',
            acks=0,
            retries=5,
            job_size=10000000,
            cafile='/my/files/cafile',
            certfile='/my/files/certfile',
            keyfile='/my/files/keyfile',
            crlfile='/my/files/crlfile'
        )
        job = queue.enqueue(my_func, *args, **kwargs)
        assert isinstance(job, Job)

    .. note::

        The number of partitions in a Kafka topic limits how many workers
        can read from the queue in parallel. For example, maximum of 10
        workers can work off a queue with 10 partitions.


    :param hosts: Comma-separated Kafka hostnames and ports. For example,
        ``"localhost:9000,localhost:8000,192.168.1.1:7000"`` is a valid input
        string. Default: ``"127.0.0.1:9092"``.
    :type hosts: str | unicode
    :param topic: Name of the Kafka topic. Default: ``"default"``.
    :type topic: str | unicode
    :param timeout: Default job timeout threshold in seconds. If not set, the
        enqueued jobs are left to run until they finish. This means a hanging
        job can potentially block the workers. Default: ``None`` (no timeout).
    :type timeout: int
    :param compression: The algorithm used for compressing job data. Allowed
        values are: ``"gzip"``, ``"snappy"`` and ``"lz4"``. Default: ``None``
        (no compression).
    :type compression: str | unicode
    :param acks: The number of acknowledgements required from the broker(s)
        before considering a job successfully enqueued. Allowed values are:

        .. code-block:: none

            0: Do not wait for any acknowledgment from the broker leader
               and consider the job enqueued as soon as it is added to
               the socket buffer. Persistence is not guaranteed on broker
               failures.

            1: Wait for the job to be saved on the broker leader but not
               for it be replicated across other brokers. If the leader
               broker fails before the replication finishes the job may
               not be persisted.

           -1: Wait for the job to be replicated across all brokers. As
               long as one of the brokers is functional job persistence
               is guaranteed.

        Default: ``1``.

    :type acks: int
    :param retries: The maximum number of attempts to re-enqueue a job when
        the job fails to reach the broker. Retries may alter the sequence of
        the enqueued jobs. Default: ``0``.
    :type retries: int
    :param job_size: The max size of each job in bytes. Default: ``1048576``.
    :type job_size: int
    :param cafile: Full path to the trusted CA certificate file.
    :type cafile: str | unicode
    :param certfile: Full path to the client certificate file.
    :type certfile: str | unicode
    :param keyfile: Full path to the client private key file.
    :type keyfile: str | unicode
    :param crlfile: Full path to the CRL file for validating certification
        expiry. This option is only available with Python 3.4+ or 2.7.9+.
